# Beyond Bootstrap
## How to Write CSS and Free Yourself from the Framework

A talk about the mindset you should have when you want to ditch the framework and roll your own CSS. Also touches on tools, separation of concerns, and styling web components (e.g. React).
Originally given to the [Society of Software Engineers](https://sse.rit.edu/committees/talks/) and a recording can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ssebot/videos/10154130757452736/).

### Setup

These slides were made with [Spectacle](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/). The Spectacle core API is available [on Github](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown).

### Development

After downloading the repo, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `npm install`

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you're ready to roll

### Build

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

### Notes

In this version of Spectacle, the speaker notes in presenter mode aren't given much space, so it's easier to read them from the actual presentation code than on the presenter mode interface.
